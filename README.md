# Funny Quilt Mod

Adds tools to annoy your friends. This is a simple refresher project,
I just wanted to make a finished mod.

## Features

Funny Item: A throwable item that plays the elder guardian jumpscare
sound in a medium radius on impact. Knocks back mobs and players it hits.

Funny Arrow: Same as the Funny Item, but is shot from a bow for ranged
harassment.
